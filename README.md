Noops
=====

#### PLEASE NOTE
##### This is probably the worst unfinished implementation you will ever see

##### Noops is and always will be a general purpose programming language without symbols ({, }, +, -, etc). I'm not starting out with a detailed specification (although a vague one is coming soon). I want the Noops community to turn Noops it into whatever the majority wants it to be. So, grab some coffee, turn on some music, and don't be a stranger.

## Current Requirements
Lua 5.* (Note: it should with 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. If it doesn't, create an issue)

## Communication
##### If you don't know about IRC, it's time to learn. We use it for ALL developer communication. We need your help, so please join us. And no, it's not on (un)Freenode.
###### If you have trouble connecting, email me (jhorne at hashbang dot sh)
```
irc.hashbang.sh/6697 #!noops
```

## How to Run
```
lua noops.lua examples/hello_world.noops
```

#### Please note, documentation on this language is coming soon. All of your questions will be answered there. I'm sure you have some.

##### But is it turing complete? Not yet.

#### Example Scripts That Work
```
hello_world.noops
variable_test.noops
empty.noops
```
